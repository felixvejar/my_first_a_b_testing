- Visualized key metrics: revenue, average order value, conversion rates.
- Detected anomalies and filtered outliers.
- Conducted statistical significance tests to evaluate differences between groups.

##Tools

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook

##Outcome

Strengthened my skills in hypothesis testing, A/B test analysis, and data-driven decision making.
